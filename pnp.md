## 0.2 Preface

Welcome to "Papers and Paychecks: The Roleplaying Game of an Industrialized and Technological Society" in which you play the part of workers and students glorious trying to succeed against a world of antagonists, and antagonistic world. One player, "The Boss", will help you build a story by positing projects and placing obstacles that will challenge the player's characters from completing the objectives of their projects. 

The title comes from the memorable artwork of Will McLean in the first edition of the "Advanced Dungeons & Dragons" Dungeon Masters Guide. A cursory search will reveal that on more than one occasion the thought has entered the heads of others that "Papers and Paychecks" would make a great roleplaying game, but this is the first time that the idea has seen completion. Of course, few workers these days deal as much with "papers", let alone "paychecks", but the game would hardly have the same ring to it if it was called "Emails and Direct Deposits". Such is the nature of being in a "industralized and technological society".

Roleplaying games have been an enormous success story in recent decades, starting with the original table-top versions and even some computer versions, in aggregate reaching out to tens of millions of people worldwide. The opportunity is provided in these games to engage in improvised storytelling within the structure of a rules system. The rules keeps the storytelling within the bounds of plausibility and the character's capabilities with some level of consistency. 

Note the word 'plausibility'. "Papers and Paychecks" posits a world that is downright hostile to the player characters. The metaphysical foundation, if you like, is resistentialism. This is a supposedly joke philosophy based around the widespread anecdotal evidence of an apparent malice of inanimate objects against people, the word itself coined by Paul Jennings in 1948 as a response to existentialism, and claimed that it was developed by a fictional character, Pierre-Marie Ventre, itself a play on the name Jean-Paul Sartre.

But of course we all know better than that. Let our motto be: "Les choses sont contre nous" ("Things are against us"). Resistentialism and it has a long and established history well prior to Jennings, as encapsulated by "Murphy's Law" (itself possibly my the mathematician de Morgan, but he already has his own law) and completely expressed by Finagle's Law of Dynamic Negatives, by John W. Campbell, science fiction writer and editor: "Anything that can go wrong, will go wrong and at the worst possible time".

Others characters in the story don't even have to be antagonistic - they may even be driven by pure motives, yet the the time in which they decide to incompetently help proves disasterous. It is the role of The Boss to ensure that this happens. Ranging from slapstick, absurdity, and even a touch of malevolence, these situational comedies can used to reminisce, inform, and inspire.

Although presented partially as a spoof, "Papers and Paychecks" is nevertheless a traditional roleplaying game, by what is meant is that it consists of several players, each taking a character (a "player-character" or PC) and their role in a story scenario designed by another player, The Boss, who adjudicates the expressed actions of the player's characters and the environment in which they occur, including the activities of non-player characters (NPCs), and introduces new plot elements as appropriate to generate a narrative flow. Usually it is played face-to-face, engaging in the primitive behaviour of actual physical socialisation, it can also be played in electronic communication as well, although real-time communication is recommended over asynchronous methods. 

There are five chapters to this book which explains tha game and how to play it. The first chapter is dedicated to character generation, covering the setting and an example of play, before illustrating the steps to build one's own player-character. This include the PCs characteristics, profession and wage band, their talents, personality, and starting equipment. For thos familiar with roleplaying games, this is a standard system but with the addition of the Luck attribute for narrative purposes.

By the end of the first chapter, the player is ready for action in an antagonistic enviroment, and the second chapter explains in detail exactly what sort of activities they can engage in. This includes an elaboration of the core mechanic game system, the tactical and strategic time scales, the giving and receiving of physical, mental, and social damage, and details of personal equipment. As a principle of game design, detail of the activiies is based around the setting. Obviously this includes a lot less violence than a roleplaying game in a fantastic setting of wizards and dragons, but a lot more on problems relating to technology and bureaucracy.

A collection of non-player characters is offered as the third chapter, broken up according to profession and across various levels of ability. These can serve as example characters whom The Boss can introduce to a storyline, or, if the player is in a hurry, a quick template to introduce a new player-character to the game. For those familiar with such things this is the equivalent of the "Monster Manual".

The fourth chapter is The Boss book. It's full of advice on what it means to take up the role of moderator, adjudicator, narrator, director, and performer of the non-player characters. It also provides valuable information on setting, scenario, and episode design, along with ideas for the physical gaming environment.

The final chapter is an entire season of "Papers and Paychecks", consisting of five episodes designed for beginning characters as they make their way into the first serious job. The episodes can be run independently, but are most enjoyable when the first links between them are brought together. 

The book concludes with a set of supplementary appendicies; a collection of source material from which a Boss can delve into and develop their own project scenarios, some charts and tables for game play in summary, a business organisation chart, a *Dramatis Personae* chart for the Boss to keep track of NPCs during a session, and a résumé (aka character sheet) for major characters.

At the end of the day however, the main purpose of "Papers and Paychecks" is enjoyment. Consider this "Rule 0" of the game. If the game is not enjoyable then something has gone wrong and it needs to be addressed. It doesn't have to be *fun*, as such, to use the etymological sense i.e., foolish. Players as well as characters can have their own assumptions challenged, and things will not always go well for their characters (indeed, in *Papers & Paychecks* they can go very bad indeed). But rather it will give "enjoyment" and the act of exploring the shared imaginary space of a fictional universe that is like many of our own lives turned "up to eleven" will be provide entertainment, amusement, and perhaps even a little bit of insight. 

This game has a set of rules that is heavily inspired by the principles of 'playable realism'. The rules are sufficiently simple, even 'rules-light' in comparison to some monstrosities that have seen the light of day, but also provide a sense of realism, or at least vermissildtude. Quite obviously, given its origins in Advanced Dungeons & Dragons (TM), one would not be surprised to see a significant influence by various editions of that game in this design. Nevertheless, as with many other games, If a situation arises that is not covered in the rules, The Boss should make a hard and fast decision to continue play and if necessary the players can all revisit the situation outside of play. Consider this "Rule 1" - The Boss Rule. All rules in this book are subject to the whim of The Boss.

By way of conclusion, a couple of other matters of note must be raised. This game does deal with situations that are obviously more contemporary, but with also 'adult concepts' (after all, it involves playing the role of adult characters) and is recommended for mature readers.  Circumstances should not arise involving the massacre an orc extended family with fire and sword, but it might involve a flirtatious and somewhat inebriated co-worker at an office party. Make of that what you will. It also means that occassionally Anglo-Saxon words for profanities will be used; Norman-French words, of course, are noble, educated, and never there profane, peasant. To rewrite George Carlin; "feces, urine, copulate, vagina, fellator, mater-copulator, and teats". 

This game has been published by the RPG Review Cooperative, an incorporated and non-profit association. Nobody associated with the Cooperative is making any money from this - all proceeds go to the association for the benefit of promoting our shared hobby - and as such we are particularly grateful for the genorsity of our backers on Kickstarter. We are also deeply honoured to have the artistic skills of Dan 'Smif' Smith for the cover art. Special thanks is also given to the playtesters, who reviewed and tested the game, pulled it apart and put it back together again into the working product you see before you. 

Have fun and remember: "Les choses sont contre nous"!

## 0.3 Dice

The polyhedral dice of tabletop roleplaying games are a well-established feature, original a mathematical tool in schools, and are readily available from hobby stores or online. A random selection from the appropriate set of options in a card deck can also be used. Dice are used to simulate the effects of various effects which are simply too fiddly to add up in the imperfect model that RPGs represent, and to create a sense of tension and uncertainty. If for some reason such dice are not available a deck of playing cards can be an equal substitute with the appropriate number range taken out as needed i.e., 1-4, 1-6, 1-8, 1-10, 1-12 and a 1-10 with black or red suit cards to determine whether the range is 1-10 (clubs or spades) or 11-20 (hearts or diamonds).

"Papers and Paychecks" uses the standard set; the four-sided dice, the six-sided, the eight-sided, the ten-sided, the twelve-sided, and the twenty-sided. Depending on the rule being applied the value on the die's face is the score that is applied. An exception is the ten-sided dice which can either be used as a single ten-sided value, or, if two are used (different colours is recommended), where one of the two represents the decimal place of tens, whereas the other represents a value of ones, creating a percentage value. A result of '00' would equate to 100, giving a range of 1 to 100.

Standard dice notation is used throughout Papers and Paychecks; a quantity of dice is specificed first followed by the 'd' notation to represent 'dice', and then the dice-value. If necessary addition and subraction may be added. Thus, by example, 2d6+4 would mean the sum of two six-sixed dice plus 4, a range of 6 to 16, 3d6 would mean the sum of three six-sided die rolls giving a range of 3 to 18, d100 would represent the percentage value explained above. 

## 0.4 Core Mechanic

The core mechanic of Papers & Paychecks, as per the original cartoon, is a 2d6 die roll to be used in dramatic circumstances, either tactical or strategic. This is applied with characteristic and skill bonus plus environment modifiers against a target number which will vary according to the difficulty of the task. As a very quick evaluation of the target numbers the following table can be used, with Target Numbers equating to the difficulty for "an average person" without modifications from specialist training, and as if negative modifiers for lacking such training existed. These target numbers can be used as a "quick and dirty" alternative to the more explicit detailed modifiers used described in chapter 2. However a couple of warnings; use one or the other, but not both at the same time, and for The Boss, be consistent.

> For example, A Boss decides to reserve the detailed calculations in the rules for strategic actions and the 'quick and dirty' method for fast, tactical circumstances. In a series of unfortunate events our workers find themselves transporting several cages rats by a trolley through a sewer system underneath a campus - however they reach a point where it the only way across is a c3m standing jump with a caged rat in a wet and dark environment, a difficulty that The Boss quickly decides is "Tough". The next character that attemps the jump should also have the same difficulty. Don't forget it, and don't hand-wave it!


| Difficulty		| Rating	|
|-----------------------|---------------|
| Very easy		| 5		|
| Easy			| 7		|
| Average		| 9		|
| Tough			| 11		|
| Challenging		| 13		|
| Formidable	 	| 15		|
| Heroic		| 17		|
| Nearly Impossible	| 19		|

The Target Numbers also however represent a grade of success or failure. If a character makes the test equal to or above the target number, the have achieved a success. If they have a result below the target number the character has failed in their task. The degree of success (or failure) also makes a difference. 

If the success is just equal to the value they receive a marginal success, but with consequences, determined by The Boss. If the player chooses a success for the character, the Boss will apply a proportional failure either immediately or at a later date. The player may decide to forgo the success and have a failure without consequences. If they succeed at a grade above the target number (e.g., a result of 11 or more for an average task) the character has succeeded without consequences. If they succeed two grades above (e.g., a result of 13 or more for an average task), the character succeeds with a benefit. Likewise if they succeed three grades above, they receive two benefits. The player may choose an benefits equal to a successful skill roll or similar check, either immediately or in the future.

> "Wait, every marginal success is also a failure?"
> "Yes, welcome to *Papers & Paychecks*, a world where... things are against us!

The same applies for failed skill rolls. If a character's skill check is within the immediate grade range below the Target Number of difficulty (e.g., a result of 7 or 8 on an Average task), the result is a marginal failure with no further consequences. If the result is a grade below (e.g., a result of 6 or 7 on an Average Taks), a further consequnce is applied in addition to the failure.

Note the initial sentence that the die roll is to be used "used in dramatic circumstances". If a character is sufficiently unhurried or has sufficient resources they can opt to ignore the die roll at take a flat 7 plus modifiers result instead; these are 'prosaic circumstances'. By 'prosaic' this means that the character has at least twice the time to take than what would be required for a dramatic action, or in the case of financial transactions, they are able to pay twice the cost. In a sense, characters are caught in the famous project management trilemma; good, cheap, or fast - pick two.

Regardless of whether a situation is 'dramatic' or 'prosiac', modifiers to a given check or roll 'stack' (i.e., combine for a cumulative effect) if they come from different sources, but do not stack if they have the same source (e.g., two uses of a skill roll).


## 0.5 Glossary

**Action**: An activity that a character performs. An action may be applied in tactical or strategic time scales. Tactical actions include standard actions, which take a moderate amount effort and time, short actions, which are quick but not not unlimited in time, and free actions, which are effectively zero time actions.

**Boss, The**: A special type of player who manages the world, the actions of Non-Player Characters, who sets the scene, scenario, and challenges for Player-Characters. The Boss acts as both a narrator and referree.

**Character**: A *natural* person (as opposed to a *legal* person, which includes companies and associations) in the *Papers & Paychecks* world. Characters are of two broad types, "Player-Characters" (PCs), those whose actions are primarily determined by a player (c.f.,), and "Non-Player Characters" (NPCs), whose actions are determined by The Boss. 

**Characteristic**: An foundational value for a character which is less subject to trained improvement. The range for starting characters is the sum of 3d6. The characteristics are Strength (STR), Intelligence (INT), Wisdom (WIS), Dexterity (DEX), Constitution (CON), and Charisma (CHA).

**Dramatic Action**: Any check that requires a roll of the dice to simulate a degree of uncertainty and narrative tension. The core mechanic of Dramatic Action in "Papers & Paychecks" is a 2d6 die roll against a target number, which can result in success with benefits, success, success with consequences, failure, failure with consequences.

**Luck**: A metagame value that players may use to alter the result of a die-roll that they are unhappy with. Luck is awarded by the GM for particularly impressive contributions to the game experience, and may also be subtracted for negative contributions. Luck is a player characteristic, not a character characteristic, and may be transferred by a player between different characters within the same gaming group.

**Player**: A real-life participant in the game. Players either manage the behaviour of Player-Characters in the game (c.f.,) or, in a particular case, take up the special role of The Boss. All players have a 'social contract' with other players to help keep the game enjoyable and interesting for everyone. Also known as "Rule 0.5", it is famously expressed by roleplayer Will Wheaton during his keynote speech at the Penny Arcade Expo (PAX) in August 2007: "Don't be a dick".

**Prosaic Action**: Any check that does not require a roll of the dice, and does not represent a situation where the character is vexed by uncertainity or narrative tension. The character opts for an average result instead of a normal die roll, but undergoes the same scope of results as a 'Dramatic Action'.

# 1.0 Character Generation

## 1.1 Example of Play

The following is the opening scene of four players of "Papers and Paperchecks". 'The Boss', has set the game with a small university research team. The other players have the characters of Walter, the team leader, a low-level manager, Ingrid, a computer scientist, Seth, a post-graduate health scientist, Mary, an administrator, and Gerald, a technician.
 
> *The Boss*: It's Monday morning at the office - small, cold, and underfunded, because those things provide great inspiration to scientific research.  However, the sweet nectar of coffee is available. Except the machine isn't working again.

> *Everyone*: *groans*.

> *Gerald*: "OK everyone, stand back. The technician is here". What's wrong with it?

> *The Boss*: The machine displays 'Dredgedrawer is full'.

> *Gerald*: Easy enough. I take the dredgedrawer out, empty it, give it a clean and put it back in.

> *The Boss*: Now it says 'Dredgedrawer missing'.

> *Gerald*: Oh come now. I wriggle it around a bit. I open and close the service door.

> *The Boss*: OK, make an 'Electrical Technician' roll at +2.

> (Gerald's player rolls a 2d6 - as per the original cartoon for "Papers and Paychecks"- and checks their resume or character sheet for their skill rating. They add their adding their skill and attribute bonus plus the +2 bonus, scoring an 10 in total, above the normal target number of 8. The result is a "success with consequences".

> *The Boss*: Congratulations, the machine roars into action. Except now it says 'Refill Beans'. (Note that the consequence is proportional to the success)

> *Mary*: That's part of my job! 

> *The Boss*: Well, we'd better check that you ordered some. An Administration check for office supplies please.

> *Mary*: It never ends. 

> (Mary's player rolls a 2d6 plus their bonuses, scoring a total of 8 - a bare success, with consequences.)

> Mary: Just as well that was one of main skills. Now please let us have a coffee!

> (The Boss considers having the milk in fridge go off, but decides against it, for now - and notes it down as a future consquence. It will make for a good event in another scene)

> *The Boss*: Well now you all have coffee according to your preferred tastes. You are in the meeting room preparing the activities for the week. Walter's phone rings. It's the head of department, Professor Fleur Power.

> *Walter*: I suppose I'd better answer it. "Hello professor! How can we help you this fine day?"

> *The Boss*: Professor Power complains about the weather. However she does mention that the Dean has received a message that the Minister of Health is making a surprise visit that there needs to be a breakthrough this week on cardiovascular disease to receive more funding.

> *Walter*: "Umm.. The Minister does know that that we just can't generate scientific discoveries like that?"

> *The Boss*: (Playing Professor Power) "No, the Minister does not know that and nor does the university marketing department. Marketing thinks we need to make the claim so we get additional funding. So get some models up and running that match some empirical tests and show that a certain activity leads to reduced blood pressure. You have until four pm". Professor Power hangs up. 

> *Walter*: Well, I'll relay the news to the rest of the team and try to inspire them. I'll roll against my "Inspire Team" skill; a 12, bringing the total to 18! (The player stands from the table and gesticulates wildly addressing the others) "Come on now team, we know the drill. At the end of the day we need to action this, so let's think outside the box, and have an idea shower. We'll look under the bonnet and get all our ducks in a row."

> (Groans from other players who have actually heard these phrases at their workplace, even as mixed metaphors) 

> *The Boss*: Very good! You get a Luck point for that truly cringeworthy performance.

> (A Luck point allows the player to modify a rolled result to whatever value they desire)

> *Seth*: Well, what do we have? Isn't there some lab rats or something on campus that are used for such studies?

> *The Boss*: Sure is; very well known too. Make a Science (biology) roll with a +2 bonus.

> *Seth*: Well that brings my score from +5 to +7, I should succeed at this. (Rolls a 11 in total). OK, I made it clean, thanks to the bonus.

> *The Boss*: Well there is the SHR, or spontaneously hypertensive rat. You also know that the medical school does have some of these and there's a special dataset that's been studying the effects of diet. There's three populations of rat, one that's been fed a diet high in fat, sodium, and alcohol, one that's been feed rich in potassium, calcium, and magnesium, and a control group that's been fed a normal diet, whatever that is for a lab rat. 

> *Mary*: "I'm not sure which rat I'll have the most sympathy for. The one that's spent its life on chips, soda, and booze and is sick or the one that's healthy and have been eating wholegrains and raw vegetables"

> *Seth*: "It doesn't matter, this is great news! We can bring up the dataset, run the simulation, and correlate the results with our loyal rodent allies who we can use to provide empirical evidence to the Minister!"

> (The Boss smiles inwardly thinking of the enormous variety of things that could go wrong with lab rats with hypertension meeting a Minister of Health. Perhaps a biting incident is in order.)

> *Ingrid*: Sounds like my cue. I bring up the database on the cluster. How long will the simulation take?

> *The Boss*: About three hours. However the system is unusually sluggish. Looks like the storage array is full.

> *Ingrid*: It never just rains, does it? OK, I do make a 'Computer (Operating Systems)' check. Total roll of 7. Ugh, what a terrible result. I spend a Luck Point and turn the failure into a success. 

> *The Boss*: Indeed, the disk is full. You've had a good look around and 'luckily' worked out where the most prominent directories are located, and with that now successful roll, you've discovered that there is a large directory of - how do I put this delicately - 'adult entertainment movies' and judging by the titles, some would make your eyes weep. They're in Professor Power's home directory.

> *Ingrid*: What? Don't we have quotas on these directories? Isn't this sort of, ummm, 'private material' against university policy?

> *The Boss*: You want a quota on the head of department? Do you you want to report them? 

> *Walter*: No, no, no. We can't do that! Professor Power controls the funding to our group and without her support, we're out on the streets and its game over for us. Maybe it's not hers? Maybe it was hackers!

> *Ingrid*: But if we don't free up some space, we'll never be able to run the simulation in time. We should just delete that directory.

> *Gerald*: I'm not sure that will make the head of department very happy.

> *Seth*: Maybe if we just temporarily move somebody else's directory? What else is there?

> *The Boss*: Well there's a large dataset of the early detection of schizophrenia in adolescents...

> *Mary*: You can move that data to one of the local drives - here on my personal computer.

> *The Boss*: You begin to move the dataset of the early detection of schizophrenia in adolescents  from the cluster to a Mary's personal computer. About half way through there is a network error and the connection is lost. Now half the data is on Mary's computer and half of it is still on the cluster. The phone starts ringing - the caller ID indicates that it's the head of the psychology department...

> (Let's leave our poor group of co-workers who have put themselves in the position of discovering questionable data that they perhaps should not have, and now possibly have been caught moving it another research team's data. Will they still have their jobs? What else could possibly go wrong? Quite a lot! This is, after all, "Papers and Paychecks"!)

## 1.2 Luck Rating

All player characters start with a Luck rating of 3 points. As a meta-game characteristic this is established prior to anything else. It represents the ability of the players to change the result of a random roll that is under their control within the story. For example. a player, during character generation, has their heart set on taking up the Scientist character class. Alas, the genetic die is not with them and they roll a paltry 7 from 3d6 to determine their Intelligence characteristic. A moment is spent as the player considers the possibility of playing a fairly dim scientist, but they decide against it spending one of their three Luck points to change the score of 7 to 18, the maximum that could be rolled.

> Other games have similar metagame currency; the *James Bond007* game had Hero/Survival points, *Rolemaster* (in a certain Companion) had Fate Points, FATE, as the name indicates, has Fate Points, *Savage Worlds* has Bennies and so forth. A crucial difference between the Luck points used in *Papers & Paychecks* is that because it is a meta-game award to the player, the number of Luck points belongs to the player, which they can use as the wish - even for or against other characters.

During the course of a story, a player who engages in particularly spectacular in-character behaviour may be awarded additional Luck points. Within the game itself, this opportunity occurs on a roll of '2' or '12', representing the extremes of skill tests, and can be expressed as particularly inspirational speeches and expositions of circumstances. On a metagame level it can awarded by dressing outrageously in character, providing a stack of possible NPCs for The Boss, or providing an utter feast for those attending the session. In a nutshell, that which makes the session truly astounding and special. Likewise failure to contribute (e.g., missing a session, going completely against the character) can cause the loss of a Luck point. A player whose character who has negative Luck points will find that The Boss will fudge random events against them - which can be very bad in the resesntialist environment.

Keep in mind that these are an metagame award to the players, not just to the characters, effectively a rating of how well they have 'acted' in character and their contribution to the game group. Hence the resume tracks the total points awarded and the points that the player has left. If a player takes up another character within their same group they can transfer their Luck points to the new character. 

Note that for certain NPCs or items of equipment, the Boss may allocate Luck points to such characters reflecting their importance in the wider story. Unlike points for PCs, these will not improve.

## 1.3 Background

The Background of a character in *Papers & Paychecks* initially consists of their starting wealth. In a general sense the price of a good equals the price of the good in the location of the game's setting, around 2016-2017 which is presumed to be in a advanced economy (e.g., North America, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Republic of Korea). In "Papers and Paychecks" characters have a starting wealth along with the income that they receive according to their level and profession. Starting wealth is random, based on a 2d6 roll, times $1000. This random roll also determines the net value of the character's inheritence. The value of this inheritence will be ten times the character's starting wealth.

The time that this inheritence is received will be on the (2d6*2) + 20th year of the character. This value will typically be kept in secret by the The Boss as part of the character's development. Note that a player may spend a Luck Point to determine exactly what age they will receive their inheritence and, in some cases, this may even occur before the start of play.

> Andrew is designing a character for *Papers & Paychecks* and rolls a '12' on 2d6 for $120,000 worth of starting wealth. Having read ahead the player likes the idea of playing a Scientist, dedicated to fighting evil in the office place. "I'll be like the office Batman!", the player exclaims. "Except I'll need even more money. I'll spend a Luck point to *kill my parents early*, and turn that result to '2' on 2d6 for age of inheritence received, which make a total of 24 years when I receive a cool $1.2 million."

> "You are *cold*", responds the Boss.

> "But only for the greater good!", the player retorts.

Other background features should be derived from the initial wealth roll. Characters with a high initial wealth, for example, will typically come from good neighbourhoods with a stable family life. At the other end of the scale are the poor in their tenement housing in their rough neighbourhoods with above average incidence of petty drug problems, violence and property crimes. As the distribution would indicate, most people fit around the middle.

Whilst it is rarely necessary when a player initially generates their character, over time a player may develop a complex background and current history for their character, including relations with immediate family, close friends, intimate associations, rivals and enemies and so forth. Such a background can provide a rich resource for The Boss to develop scenarios and a well-developed and probable background will receive rewards in the form of having such associated characters being part of the project scenarios and with the reward of Luck Points.

## 1.4 Characteristics

Characteristics are the basic attribitues of a "Papers and Paychecks" character. They are used to determine innate abilities which are not augmented by skills, and they determine the default values for various skills. As with numerous other games, Characteristics are determined by the sum of a 3d6 rolls, six times in order, for Strength (STR), Intelligence (INT), Wisdom (WIS), Dexterity (DEX), Consitution (CON), and Charisma (CHA). 

Players are reminded of their Luck Rating (1.2) and may wish to take the opportunity to use at least one point when generating these values. "Papers and Paychecks" is "realistic" insofar that characteristics are random, but "narrativist", in the sense that players can intervene if they so choose to ensure that they have the sort of character they want. 

Characters in "Papers and Paychecks" have level one starting age based on their profession. However as the age category for all level one characters is based on the "young adult" age category the practical effect is that they will begin with the same range of characteristic values. Again, as a "realistic" game there is significant modifications according to age. The effects of each aging step are non-cumulative.

Starting Age
15+1d4 (average 17-18) Labourers
15+3d4 (average 22-23) Scientists

Sexual dimorphism in the human species across cultures is a well-documented reality; in game terms this would mean that female characters would, on average, have a Strength attribute about 20% less, but a bonus to Constitution and Dexterity of around 10% more. Likewise 'racial' (clinal) differences indicating gradual change throughout the species along with epigenetic influences as well. The Boss should keep these distributions in mind when generating NPCs. Player-characters may, of course, choose whatever sex or ethnic background that they desire according to the die-roll results.

The result of the 3d6 roll gives a range of 3-18. A universal table for bonuses or penalties for characteristic values is applied for skill tests similar tests when the characteristic in question is invoked. In addition the bonus multiplied by 10% is used for pay for relevant professions and for Wisdom to represent their prudent expenditures and investments. 

For example, a character with a Strength of 18 will receive a +4 bonus for all Strength-related skill tests. If the same character is a Labourer they will receive a bonus of +40% to their average weekly wage. If they also had a Wisdom of 12, the character would receive a bonus of +50%!
 
| Value | Skill Bonus | Wage Bonus | 
|-------|-------------|------------|
| 1	|       -5    |    -50%    |
| 2-3	|       -4    |    -40%    |
| 4-5	|       -3    |    -30%    |
| 6-7	|       -2    |    -20%    | 
| 8-9	|       -1    |    -10%    |
| 10-11	|        0    |      0%    |
| 12-13	|       +1    |    -10%    |
| 14-15	|       +2    |    -20%    |
| 16-17	|       +3    |    -30%    | 
| 18-19	|       +4    |    +40%    |
| etc	|       etc   |    etc     |

In addition to the aforementioned primary characteristics there is also a number of secondary, derived, or enumerated characteristics (pick whichever term suits your group and their level of geekdom, but "secondary" will be used as the lowest common denominator). 

**Strength**: Strength represents the both the musculture of the character and their knowledge of how to use it effectively.  By itself Strength doesn't contribute much in terms of skills (the characteristic bonus is applied in melee combat), but it does include a number of secondary characteristics. Also, various physical feats are dependent on Strength, including lifting things, moving things, shoving them over, the distance they can jump, and so forth. See sections 2.3 (Tactical Task Resolution) and 2.4 (Strategic Task Resolution) for further details.

The average of a character's Strength and Constitution represents a character's Size and body shape as a secondary characteristic; a character with a high Strength and low Constitution will be tall but thin, a character with a low Strength and high Constitition will be short and stout. The average of a character's Strength and Dexterity multiplied by five provides the character's Move. This secondary characteristic defines how many metres per ten-second tactical round a character can move unencumbered. A character's capacity to carry things, their Encumbrance rating, is based on their Strength; equal to their Strength in kilograms with no penalty, twice their Strength in kilograms with light encumbrance, three times their Strength in kilograms for medium encumbrance, six times for heavy encumbrance, and ten times their Strength is kilograms for very heavy. 

**Intelligence**: Intelligence is a combination of a character's memory, reasoning, and general education. Almost the reverse of Strength, it is not used for many unskilled actions with the exception of occasional pure logic problems or general knowledge questions, but it is used a great deal as the default value for many skills. Intelligence is a major factor in the number of skill points a character acquires per level; 4 + INT bonus (a character can have as low as 0 skill points per level, i.e. "too stupid to learn"). Intelligence sets a hard limit to the number of skill points that a character can invest. At five time their INT, a character must "forget" old skills that have not been used if they wish to learn new skills, equal to their learning rate.

**Wisdom**: Wisdom represents the character's stability of mind, willpower, intellectual clarity, judgement, and common sense. Wisdom however does not contribute significantly to secondary characteristics or skills, with most resolution tests being based directly on tests against the characteristic itself. An important exception is that a character's Wisdom bonus times 10% directly contributes as a wage bonus, representing both prudent investments and expenditure, plus performance bonuses. This applies to all professions, and effectively doubles the bonus for Administrators.

**Dexterity**: Dexterity represents fine manipulation, reflexes, flexibility, balance, and hand-eye coordination. It is used in a significant number of physical skills, and is also fairly common in direct characteristic tests. A character receives one standard action at 5 points or less of Dexterity, two from 6 to 15, three from 16 to 25 etc.

**Consitution**: Constitution represents the character's physical health, energy, and resilience to sickness. Constitution does contribute to a few secondary characteristics and skills, however most resolution tests being based directly on tests against the characteristic itself, or gradual effects over time (e.g., aging). As mentioned under Strength, the average of a character's Strength and Constitution represents a character's Size and body shape as a secondary characteristic. 

**Charisma**: Charisma is a combination personality, popularity, appearance, and social status. Charisma modifiers are used in a large variety of social skills, as well as tests for loyalty of friends and associates. It does not, however, contribute significantly to secondary skills.

## 1.5 Professions

"Papers and Paychecks" has six character professions, each of which has a related primary characteristic. The player chooses which character profession they belong to and in most cases will select the profession with that primary characterstic. Not only are many of the character's activities most successful with that related value, but they will also receive a pay bonus.

The professions, and their related primary characteristic, are: Labourer (Strength)., Scientist (Intelligence)., Administrator (Wisdom)., Tradesperson (Dexterity)., Researcher (Constitution)., Manager (Charisma). The pay bonus or penalty they receive is equal to ten times the characteristic bonus as a percentage. That is, a Labourer with the extraordinary Strenth of 18, would receive a 40% bonus in their paycheck.

As with other classic games, "Papers and Paychecks" is a "gold piece system", but in reverse. Whereas in traditional RPGs one received "experience points" for acquring treasure, in "Papers and Paychecks" your character will receive "treasure" (i.e., a paycheck) for having experience. 

This is also a "class and level" game. The "classes" are, of course, represented by the various professions. Unlike however traditional games, the "class" is not a straight-jacket which restricts the character, in "Papers and Paychecks" the profession is a flexible set of options. Characters may also change their profession as they wish, and often a character will have multiple professions representing a change in employment (e.g., a level 4 Labourer and level 6 Tradesperson). The character will receive the payrate according to the work that they are currently doing. If this sounds unfair, ask a migrant cleaner with a PhD in nuclear physics how they feel about it.

Each character has a level, representing their pay band and the base net wages that they receive. This level is determined by how many "projects" that they have completed, a "project" being the equivalent of a "scenario" in a fantasy RPG. On average, a character can expect to participate in one project per annum. Different professions have different starting ages, and different rates of pay. 

The abstract level rate of advancedment is however the same, depending on the number of projects completed. Papers & Paychecks assumes that low-level characters will undergo one or perhaps two major projects in an exceptional, with the rest of their time engaging in operational work. As a result the sum total of a character's level can be used to estimate the character's age as well, at least at low levels. At higher levels however it is not unusual for characters to become more project-focussed. Very experienced and successful characters may find that they are constantly in project roles, as major troubleshooters.

| Level | Projects | Average Age |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| 1	| 0        |     20      |
| 2	| 1        |     21      |
| 3	| 2        |     22      |
| 4	| 3        |     23      |
| 5	| 5        |     25      |
| 6	| 8        |     28      |
| 7	| 13       |     33      |
| 8	| 21       |     41      |
| 9	| 34       |     50      |
| 10	| 65       |     58      |

Each level brings improvements to a character based on their profession. To represent character development, players can change their MBTI personality value (see section 1.8, Personality) by one point in each of the four dimensions. 

Note that there is no level after 10. After several projects at this level, having completed over 65 projects in a chosen profession there will be various hints expressed throughout the workplace that "perhaps you should spend more time with your family", "wouldn't it be great to receive a gold watch", "it's wonderul that younger people are following in your footsteps", and such-like. At a certain point the character will have to realise that their life has been spent as a cog in someone else's machine. Take out a red pen and write "RETIRED" across your character sheet, and hope there's enough money in the character's pension fund.

### 1.5.1 Labourer

Prime Requisite: Strength
Starting Age: 15+1d4
Profession Skills: Brawl, Intimidate, Language (own), Profession (own)

Description: A labourer works with their hands for the livelihood. Typically found in the construction industry, it is not a character profession that has a wide range of skills, nor does that is often found within an office-environment. Nevertheless there are several significant advantages to playing a labourer. Firstly, they are the only profession that gains points in physical characteristics as their level improves. Secondly, labourers have a very good weekly-wage for a profession, at least in the initial levels. The starting age of a labourer with no prior profession is often quite young.

Starting at first level, and for every level thereafter, a labourer gains +1 to either Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution, accoding to the player's choice.

## 1.6 Skills and Knowledges

Skills and other actions in "Papers and Paychecks" are determined by the following procedure, as per the original cartoon:  2d6 + characteristic bonus or penalty + environment bonuses or penalty versus a target number 8, 11, or 14 for degrees of narrative success, but with the raw value representing an absolute degree of raw success. There are no "natural" successes or failures from rolling a '2' or '12', for example, as a result; a character *could* succeed with a natural roll of '2' if their bonuses are high enough or fail with a '12' if their penalties are sufficiently severe. Further elaboration of the resolution of action will be found in chapter two, especially sections 2.3 and 2.4

Skills are defined by their associated characteristic, the default value, and the encumbrance penalty if applicable. The associated characteristic is a modifier to the skill attempted. The default value is a penalty that is applied if the character has no training or experience in that skill, that is, they are operating from their natural acumen alone.

At this stage, the skills are given the briefiest descriptions to satisfy the requirements of character generation. A fuller description of their implementation is found in section 2.2 and section 2.3

### Strength Based Skills

There are few Strength based skills, but they have a wide application. Strength-based skills have a default of -2 for the unksilled, recognising that these skills are heavily influenced by the physical ability of the character.

**Brawl**

A Brawl check is applied each round that a character is attempting to hit something with the fists, kick them, head-butt them, and even engage in close-combat hand-to-hand weapons such as knives and daggers. The Brawl check is contested against the defense of the opponent and the difference is used to determine the damage caused. 

**Climb**

A Climb check is necessary every round whenever a character is required to move along a steep incline, defined as 50 degrees or more. Encumbrance penalties apply to Climb checks.

**Intimidate**

An Intimidate check is used when a character wishes to make another character comply to their wishes through use of a physical threat.

**Jump**

A Jump check is necessary when a player dictates that the character will attempt to leap without touching an intervening surface. Encumbrance penalties apply to Jump checks. The distance covered will depend on the type of Jump attempted, with modifiers according to the conditions. 

**Swim**

A Swim check is necessary each round that a character is in water, with a successful check allowing quarter normal moving rate. A character who fails a Swim check may find themselves drowning.

### Intelligence Based Skills

There are many Intelligence based skills and they tend to have a relatively narrow focus. Intelligence-based skills have a default of -6 for the unksilled, recognising that it is far more difficult to figure out a problem from first principles in lieu of training.

**Craft (Computing)**

A Computing check is needed for sophisticated user, file operations, networking, hardware modifications, and programming. Major tasks which contain a degree of uniqueness (everything from building a high performance computing system or even formatting a new roleplaying game) should be classified as projects, and need to be carried out in strategic time.

**Craft (chemical)**

A Craft (chemical) check is used when a character is mixing chemicals. In most cases this will be for benign purposes, however a test is typically required when the character is engaging in dangerous admixture, whether at the time of production, or of application. This includes the production of acids, strong bases, drugs, and poisons. Note that this skill is the laboratory activity of producing chemicals, that is, the ability to use apparatus and follow a recipe. For the science of chemistry, see Knowledge (science - chemistry).

**Craft (pharmaceutical)**

A Craft (pharmaceutical) check is used to compound drugs, whether to produce a tablet, liquid, or even gaseous medicine. This includes the ability to dispense safe and effective doseages to aid healing, or conversely, to deliberately provide poisonous dosages. Use of this skill is effective for hospital pharmaceutical professions, clinical pharmacy, ambulatory care, veterinary pharmacy etc.

**Craft (writing)**

A Craft (writing) skill check is typically used when a character is composing an *important* email, 'blog, media release, advertisement, business report, research paper, as well as forms of creative fiction such as poetry, screenplays, novels etc.

**Investigate**

An Investigate skill is used to apply forensics, discover clues, and engage in analysis, removing improbable speculations by the availability of evidence. This skill also includes the ability to use a crime laboratory which can enhance the scope of available clues.

> It is a great idea for a character to make use of their Luck characteristic with the use of the Investigate skill. The need for investigation is usually is only applied when the situation and scene is sufficiently important. 

**Knowledge (various)** 

A Knowledge skill check is used against any critical application of a theoretical knowledge. Mant other skill consist of a combination of knowledge and practise ("know how"), whereas knowledge skills are a combination of theory and knowledge ("know what"). There are many knowledge skills (like Craft skills) and each have an optional specialisation. 

**Knowledge (Arts)** 

A Knowledge (Arts) check is used whenever a character wishes to evaluate aesthetic expressions. This will includes knowledge of medium (literature, film, painting, sculpture, music, architecture), styles (modernism, neoclassical, baroque, medieval), and institutions (schools, stores, galleries), and people (artists, agents, collectors, academics)

**Knowledge (Laws)** 

A Knowledge (Laws) check is used whenever a character wishees to evaluate normative regulations. This includes legal principles and systems (natural law, torts, contracts, criminal), political ideologies (socialism, liberalism, conservativism, fascism), institutions (courts, assemblies), and people (lawyers, politicians, police, academics).

**Knowledge (Sciences)**



**Language (various)**


### Wisdom Based Skills

There are a moderate number of Wisdom based skills and they tend to have an average focus. Wisdom-based skills have a default of -4 for the unksilled, existing in the middle of influence of natural ability and training.

Administration, 
Gamble, 
Listen, 
Profession (specialisation), 
Survival

### Dexterity Based Skills

There are many Dexterity based skills and they tend to have an average focus. Dexterity-based skills have a default of -4 for the unksilled, existing in the middle of influence of natural ability and training.

**Craft (electronic)**

A Craft (electronic) check is used to build and repair electronic equipment assuming component materials (vacuum tubes, transistors, diodes, integrated circuits etc),  including audio-visual equipment, timers, radio and television equipment, information processing switches, and signal processing.

**Craft (mechanical)**

A Craft (mechanic) check is used to build and repair mechanical equipment, that is, machinery based on the behaviour of physical bodies when subjected to forces and displacements. This includes automatic machinery, boilers, air conditioning and refrigeration, aircraft, and various mills.

**Craft (structural)**

A Craft (structural) check is used when a character is producing various items related to the home, building and construction industry from various materials including wood, metal, or concrete. It includes various furnishings and fittings, structural painting, plastering, tiling, cement laying, plumbing, and building electrics.

**Craft (art)**

A Craft (visual art) check is used when a character is engaging in the production, repair, or restoration of items of fine art through an object medium (i.e., excluding acting, music, etc). This includes painting, jewellry, sculpture, and video.

### Constitution Based Skills

There are few Constitution based skills, but they have a wide application. Costitution-based skills have a default of -2 for the unksilled, recognising that these skills are heavily influenced by the physical ability of the character.

Concentration, 
Hiking, 
Perception

### Charisma Based Skills

There are few Charisma based skills, but they have a wide application. Charisma-based skills have a default of -2 for the unksilled, recognising that these skills are heavily influenced by the natural ability of the character.

**Act**

An Act check is required when a character attempts to take on a role and pretend to be someone with different motivations and interests than what is truly their own. This is often a professional skill in its own right, and is usually applied strategically rather than tactically (which differentiates it from Lie). An check against Act, if necessary, is carried out as a contested skills against a [EDIT] check of the opponent.
 
**Blather**


**Bully**

A Bully check is required when a character attempts to make another character or characters comply with threats, stated or implied. A Bully check is applied tactically and is carried out as an opposed test against the target's [EDIT]. Bullying is significantly more difficult if the bullier lacks social position or is attempted against a group of people.

**Inspire**

**Lie**

A Lie is an attempt to mislead whether by emphasis, omission, or contradiction of the facts, and is contested by a [EDIT] check of the target. The more believable the lie is, based on plausibility and consistency, the more likely it is to succeed. The reputation and previous experience of a character to the liar also modifies their chance to succeed. A character who has personally suffered at the hands of a liar due to one of their lies (i.e., has taken physical, social, or mental damage in the past) will be "deeply suspicious" of the liar.

**Seduce**

## 1.7 Perks and Flaws

Feats? EDIT

## 1.8 Personality

*"Most personality psychologists regard the MBTI as little more than an elaborate Chinese fortune cookie"*
Robert Hogan

Like much of the corporate world, *Papers & Paychecks* uses the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator as a summary of a character's personality, and mapped to the Keirsey Temperament Sorter, both of which are derived from Jungian psychology. Like most aspects of roleplaying games, this is expressed in the simplified form, without auxiliary functions for example. In other games this is the equivalent of their "alignment". As a roleplaying game, a player should play according to the role of their character. 

Whilst the player is given a choice about the personality values of their Type, within the range of 3-18, and an option is designed for random generation on 3d6. Note that contrary to original expectations the four dichotomies of MBTI tend towards a more normal distribution rather than a bipolar distribution. In addition the formal MBTI uses absolute values rather than a continuum.

**Favorite world: Extraversion/Introversion**

Extraversion and Introversion are preferences in MBTI, which may not map to actual activities. In a general sense, Extraverted characters are outward-focussed by preference, whereas Intraverted characters are inward-focussed by preference. This does not mean that extraverted characters necessarily prefer action to thought (or vice-versa for introverts), but rather their actions have different reasons; the extravert will think in order to engage with the extrernal world, the introvert will act in order to engage with their inner world. 

Socially, extraverted characters are often engaged in the company of others, and are energised by social interactions, especially with a wide variety of individuals and ideas. Introverted characters prefer smaller close-knit groups, or even their own company. This should not be confused with social anxiety issues; an extraverted character could suffer from stage fright, just as an introverted person could be perfectly fine with other people; they would just *prefer* to bury their nose in a book.

**Information: Sensing/Intuition***

Sensing and Intuition are information-gathering functions in the MBTI. Again, it is a preferential model. In a general sense, Sensing characters are orientated towards giving credence to information that is immediate, empirical, and tangible, coming from their senses. In contrast Intuition characters are more trusting of information that is contextual, rational, and abstract. 

A Sensing character will prefer to recall events as a set of facts, whereas the Intuitive character will recall them as contexts and flow. Sensing characters will solve problems but each step in a serial and linear manner, whereas an Intuition character will solve problems by taking in ideas, interpretations, and possibilities from a variety of sources. Sensing and Intuition must be understood as information-gathering traits, rather than a sensual response. An Intuitive character can still be a person who enjoys physical sensation, just a Sensing character could dislike physical sensations.

**Decision: Thinking/Feeling**

Thinking and Feeling are preferential choices when making decisions in the MBTI. Characters with a Thinking preference tend to look towards internal consistency as their primary source with a degree of detached fairness, whereas characters with a Feeling preference tend towards the particular circumstances and feelings of the people involved.

Characters who prefer Thinking for decision making are not necessarily "thinkers" or more intelligent or rational, and likewise people who have Feeling for decision making are not necessarily more sensate, or even more empathic. The MBTI eveluates preferences, not ability. 

**Orientation: Judging/Perception**

Judging and Perception are perferential choices when orientating one's self to the external world. Characters with a Judging preference prefer an organized and planned approach to life that has a high degree of structure so they can be make contingencies. A Perceiving character has a preference of living that has a higher degree of flexibility and spontaneity so they can adapt to new circumstances.

Characters who prefer Judging are not necessarily judgemental, and characters who prefer Perceiving are not necessarily more perceptive. It is an expresssion of how one prefers to organise their interactions with the external world.

**Game Use**

With an assignment or from random determination, characters will have MBTI values for the four paired values. From here, a bonus is derived in the same manner that is done for characteristics, based on the dominant value of the pair or for the first value if the bonus is +0. When a situation arises when a preference is called (e.g., a matter of world preference, of information gathering, of decision making, of world orientation) the player may optionally roll 2d6 against a target number of 7 (easy) to *guide* their approach, adding the appropriate bonuse. The degree of 'success' above the target number establishes a commitment to a particular approach to the dominant pair, and likewise the degree of 'failure' represents a commitment to the opposite pair.

For example: Russel Wrench, a mild mannered computer programmer, has randomly determined the paired characteristics: Extraversion 6 (-2) which becomes Introversion (+2), Sensing 9 which becomes Intuition (+1), Thinking 12 (+1), and Judging 14 (+2). The player marks in the character sheet under personality I+2,N+1,T+1,J+2

**Keirsey Temperament Sorter**

The Keirsey Temperament Sorter provides roles which can be mapped to MBTI values. These are provided here as a shortcut for players to make an "at a glance" overall decision of a character's behaviour. Kersey assessed characters on whether they were orientated by preference towards the concrete and the abstract, then whether they were cooperative or utilitarian, then informative or directive, and finally expressive or attentive.

For example, Russel Wrench is a "Mastermind", and that is added in the the character sheet next to the personality values.

The Boss should show interest in how players use these results as it represents playing according to the character's psychological preferences. A consistent use of such character preferences by a player, especially when it is contrary to the character's interests at the time should result in a Luck Point reward.

> Boss: OK, you're in for the big technical meeting. The manager and the team are there, all NPCs except you. Everyone's really pumped out and excited about this new roll-out of a massive new storage system for the company, with a new operating system and storage protocol. Everyone's talking over one another, scribbling on white boards and debating what tasks they're going to do. Rodney, what's your character, Russell Wrench, up to?

> Rodney: My character has Introversion at +2, I make a check and roll a ... ahh, an 11. Russell will pull out his laptop and start reading through some technical specifications for operating system and storage protocol.

> Boss: Whoa, the manager is not impressed with that at all, "This is a *team* meeting Russell, your input is appreciated. A *lot* of money is being spent on this project, including a lot of money on *your* wages. We expect value for money", he says tersely.

> Rodney: Russell ignores the manager for several seconds and finally mutters something about going over the technical details.

> Boss: Ha! That's excellent. Give yourself a Luck Point for playing in character even when the character is under threat. The manager explodes at you, "When ask you to participate, Mr. Wrench, I am giving an *order*, not an *option*. We have come here for a team meeting to determine the roll-out of a two million dollar project, and here you are wasting company time playing around on your laptop. Either you contribute or get out of here!". The room falls silent and everyone turns looking at you. Your move.

> Rodney: Huh, attack is the best defense. I initiate a social attack against the manager. I'll make a Computer roll, and spend my Luck Point to make it a 12. That's my best skill and brings it to a total of 18. What's the manager's defense?

> Boss: Er, well, he's really set himself up for this, so I guess it's a counter-attack with Bully! His bonus is +5 total and he rolls a, ahh, 5, for a total of 10. You win by 8 points, that's a huge loss to his Charisma, even with his professional defense it'll take him months to recover. OK, what do you do?

> Rodney: Russell closes the lid of his laptop, gets up, and says, "The operating system and the storage protocol are incompatible". He glares at the manager. "I've just saved the company two million dollars - and saved your job", and then walks out the door.

> Boss: Drops mic, eh?

> Rodney: *nods* Drops mic.


# 2.0 Actions and The Environment

## 2.1 Time and Core Mechanic

2d6 for all actions; results are skill (bonus) + stat (bonus). Variable negatives for skills according to type (generally, mental skills will have a bigger negative than positive)

Critical Success 14+ (success with benefits) 
Success: 11+ (success, no consequences)
Marginal success: 8-10 (success but with consequences)
Marginal failure 5-7 (failure with no consequences)
Critical failure 1-3 (failure with consequences)

[EDIT: Strategic time, 3.5 hours (morning 3.5, lunch .5, afternoon 3.5)]

## 2.2 The Resistentialist Environment

**Drinking Alcohol**

If the number of standard doses equals a quarter of the character's CON, they must make a CON characteristic test with a target number of 11. If they fail, they will feel nauseous, but with no additio

**Drowning and Suffocation**

A character's capacity to hold their breath is equal to twice their Constitution score; if they engage in any actions whilst in this situation that counts as an additional round's worth (so an active character can only hold their breath for half as long), exertion is four times the at-rest consumption, and maximun exertion is eight times. Once the character is out of breath, they must make a Constitution characteristic test with a target number of 5, and increasing one per round. If the Constitution check is failed, they fall unconscious (dropping to zero hit points immediately), and will lose one hit point every round from then on. Water is not the only substance a character can drown in. A character can drown in sand, mud, snow, grain etc. Most appropriately, circumstances may occur where a character drowns in paperwork. *Wouldn't that be ironic?*

Gradual suffocation uses similar rules to drowning. If there is no availability of air, use the same rules as above. If the body is in an enclosed space the process will be slower. A person trapped in a coffin or a sealed stationary cabinet for example will use up their oxygen supply in approximately five and a half hours. The boot of a car is not sealed so suffocation would not apply, unless the boot has been especially designed to be airtight, and cars themselves are not airtight either. For places that are airtight, multiple the example of the stationary cabinet according to volume. An alternative is the replacement of the existing air supply in a vehicle or other enclosed space (e.g., supplying carbon monoxide to a car). This typically takes several minutes, then apply the general rules for drowning. 

**Falling**

If a character falls each second after that they may attempt at a -5 DEX test to stabilise themselves and grab onto something (i.e., at 5m, 20m, 125m). That 'something' will probably be the big and friendly ground. Being attached by a rope to something stable is advisable when climbing any significant distance. 

## 2.3 Tactical Task Resolution

A tactical round is a period of six seconds. It is used for physically dramatic actions where immediate time as of the essence which includes, as per the great time-honoured tradition of roleplaying games, of physical combat. Each tactical round's activity begins with the character with the highest physical initiative score, based on their Dexterity, and then proceeds in order to the lowest. A tactical round should be perceived as an abstract method for organising time and the sequence of action declarations when, of course, activity occurs in a continuous rate.

A character typically may take two 'standard actions' in a tactical round. A standard action usually means make a skill roll or a move. In addition to standard actions there are short actions. A 'short action' is something that is performed quickly and can be combined with a standard action (e.g., get a something out of your pocket). A character is limited to two short actions per standard action, plus the character's DEX bonus. If the DEX bonus reduces this quantity to less to 0 or less then the character may has to count short actions as standard actions; all other things being equal this would only occur if the character has a DEX of 5 or less. Finally, there is a small number of actions (('free actions') which effectively take no time at all (e.g., drop an item).

**Bully**

A successful Bully check, contested by an opponent's Wisdom check, persuades another character to attempt to behave in a certain way by use of real or implied threats. The ability to Bully is significantly altered by the quantity of people that the attempt is applied against (individuals in a group get their own check and a bonus for being part of a group), the demanded action, and the position of the attacker. An interesting aspect of the Bully skill is that whilst it is tactical, the effects are strategic and ablative; an additional Wisdom check, at +1 per strategic turn of work, is allowed, until the bullied target succeed. A single check is made for the number of consective standard actions taken on a Bully check.

1 standard action of Bullying -2 
2 standard actions of Bullying -1
4 standard actions of Bullying +0
6 standard actions of Bullying +1
8 standard actions of Bullying +2
10 standard actions of Bullying +3
12 standard actions of Bullying +4

Single target +0
Two targets -1
Three targets -2
Four targets -3
etc

Bully in superior position in organisation +0
Bully in direct managerial position over target +2
Bully in inferior position in organisation -4
Bully not in organisation +0 (must use external threats)
Bully in a position to use or threaten violence +4

**Brawl**

**Climb**

There is a modifier to the climb check depending on the angle of the incline. Handholds are *required* for any incline of 90 degrees or more.

50 degrees to 59 degrees: +2
60 degrees to 69 degrees: +1
70 degrees to 79 degrees: +0
80 degrees to 89 degrees: -1
90 degrees to 109 degrees: -2 
110 degrees to 139 degrees: -3
140 degrees to 180 degrees: -4

There are also modifiers on the type of surface:

Smooth worked material with no handholds: -4
Rough surface, such as a crumbling building or natural rock: -2
Very rough surface with handholds and footholds (e.g., rope, etc): +0
Normal climbable surface (e.g., rigging, tree etc): +2
A ladder on a stable surface: +4 

The width of the surface that the character is climbing also modifies the chance.

More than 30cm wide: +0
More than 10cm, less than 30cm: -2
Less than 10cm: -4

A character with one limb missing or unavailable has a penalty of -2 for climbing, and -4 for two limbs missing (it is difficult, but far from impossible for a paraplegic to climb). 

If the character has a critical success they can move up to 1/2 their normal speed. If they succeed, or succeed with consequences, they can move at 1/4 of their normal rate. If they fail, they do not move at all. If they critically fail, they will fall (see Falling, EDIT). 

A character's Dexterity whilst climbing for the purpose of avoidance (such as dodging), is equal to the movement modifiers given above (e.g., a character who is moving at 1/4 of their normal Speed will have 1/4 of their normal Dexterity; this will usually mean that they are quite an easy target).

A character may attempt to catch an falling object (e.g., another character) whilst climbing. This requires a successful Brawl action against the Dexterity-based velocity of the falling object and its size as elaborated in the physical combat rules. However if the total weight exceeds the Encumbrance limit of the character they will also require a Climb check.

If a character takes physical damage whilst climbing, they will need to make a Concentration skill roll with a modifier equal to the damage taken. If the roll is failed another Climb skill roll is required for that round.

If the equipment is availble, a character may attempt to improve the surface they are climbing by making additional handholds. For every six rounds of using hammer and pitons, or ice-picks, or similar, they may improve the bonus by +1 for every metre of movement. 

**Computing**

The difficulty of a Computing check depends on the activity being carried out.

Very easy	5 Use a word processor effectively, use simple commands, attach a peripheral,
Easy	7 Basic use of spreadsheet, simple use of a database, use options to commands, insert a internal card
Average	9 Apply simple formulae in a spreadsheet or database, write a simple script, use complex commands, compile a simple program, troubleshoot a failed network connection, bypass an insecure computer system
Tough	11 Write a complex spreadsheet or database query, write a complex script, compile a program with depedencies, network an office and peripherals, build a PC from components, determine basic security flaws in an unpatched operating system. 
Challenging	13 exploit basic security flaws, identity complex security flaws 
Formidable 	15 exploit complex security flaws
Heroic	17 
Nearly impossible	19

The number of standard actions taken to carry out an activity very much depends on the scale and complexity of the task. For example, finding a file or keyphrase in a collection of files is either very easy or easy, and will remain of that difficulty regardless of the scale; it is the time that may be of an issue. Conducting such a search on a personal computer (laptop or desktop) will take 3 standard actions, on a small office network of it would take several standard actions, for a large corporate network anywhere up to 1000 standard actions or more. Note however that just a single roll is required; the time taken is the processsing of the search; assume two standard actions to type the command, and then one standard action per personal directory for the processing of a command.

Another common activity, especially from player characters, is attempts to bypass computer security. This can be achieved through two basic methods. The first, heavily emulated in various roleplaying games, is to find flaws in the operating system which can be exploited. Whilst it depends on the operating system and how regularly it is patched, the general level of difficulty is quite high. The second, an easier method in many ways, is various forms of social engineering and trickery against users. In this case the exploit depends on how careful the user in question is. Typically user passwords can be obtained from either through brute force, educated guesses, or a well-timed wrench-blow to sensitive areas of their anatomy.

**Jump**

Jump is heavily modified by the velocity of the character from the round prior to jumping. A velocity of 0m/round equates with a standing jump.

0m/round: -4
4m/round: -2
8m/round: +0
12m/round: +2
16m/round: +4
etc 

For a long jump, a horizontal move, the distance is equal to the result in metres. At the midpoint of the jump, the character will have a vertical height of equal to one-quarter of the horizontal distance. For a high jump, a verticle move, the distance jumped is equal to one quarter of the result in meters. 

**Lie**

"He offered alternative facts"
Kellyanne Conway denies Trump press secretary lied
https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jan/23/kellyanne-conway-alternative-facts-lies

> **Where's My Sense Motive?** In certain games a Sense Motive or similar skill can be used as an opposed test against similar skills (e.g., Bluff, Fast Talk, Chutzpah). This is terribly unrealistic and no much fun, so it isn't used in *Papers and Paychecks*. A handful of people have the perceptive ability to truly pick up on the unconscious nonverbal communication (kinesics) when one is being told a lie, it is not something that one can *learn*. This ability is incorporated into the Wisdom score. 

Plausibility
The lie is believable and doesn't affect the target. 	+0
The lie is a little hard to believe or puts the target at risk. 	-2
The lie is implausible or is very risky for the target. 	-4
The lie is extremely implausible, almost impossible 	-6

Gullibility
The target wants to believe the liar. +2
The target is suspicious of the liar. -2
The target is deeply suspicious of the liar. -4

Cleverly applied, a Lie can be used in physical, social, or mental combat. A successful lie against a wisdom check means that the next combat action by the character will 


**Swim**

A character must make a Swim check each round while they are in water. A successful check will allow the character to move at one quarter of their normal rate. A failure without consequences means that they have made no progress, and a failure with consequences means that they are beginning to drown.

Target numbers for Swim checks depend on the ferocity of the water, which is measured by the Douglas Scale. This is  also called the "international sea and swell scale", and was devised in the 1920s by Captain H.P. Douglas of the Royal Navy, who knew a little bit about the subject. The Target Number starts with a  base of 5, and increases by an additional +2 per level on the Scale.

5	0 	no wave 	Calm (Glassy)
7	1 	0–0.10 		Calm (rippled)
9	2 	0.10–0.50 	Smooth
11	3 	0.50–1.25 	Slight
13	4 	1.25–2.50 	Moderate
15	5 	2.50–4.00 	Rough
17	6 	4.00–6.00 	Very rough
19	7 	6.00–9.00 	High
21	8 	9.00–14.00 	Very high
23	9 	14.00+ 		Phenomenal

If a character's head is underwater they begin to drown. See Section 2.2 for the unfortunate effects of Drowning. Note for Boss; if the weather is right, water roughness is known to change quite quickly, especially at sea. 


## 2.4 Strategic Task Resolution

**Act**




## 2.5 Damage and Healing

The purpose of combat is to hurt someone; except you can get hurt as well.

1. Initiative
- based on Dexterity (for physical), based on Wisdom (for mental), based on total Level (for social)
- Maneuvers 
-- normal attack, normal defense
-- all out attack, +3 to hit, no defense
-- all out damage, +1x damage, no defense
-- all out defense, -3 to hit, no attack
-- all out damage reduction, -1x damage, but no attack 
-- retreat

2. Damage is based on the attack type
- Calculate difference between attack roll and defense roll (e.g., 13 vs 10 = 3). That's the base damage.
- For physical attacks (fists = 1x, clubs, knives = 2x, swords = 3x, guns = 4x, situation +x)
- For mental attacks (normal = 1x, various perks and situation +x)
- For social attacks (normal = 1x, various perks, status, and situation +x)

3. Injuries
- Physical wounds are applied against CON-base HP (0 is unconscious and out-of-project and negative is dead and out-of-game)
- Mental wounds are applied against WIS-base HP (0 is breakdown and out-of-project, and negative is permanently insane)
- Social wounds are applied against CHA-base HP (0 is loss of reputation and out-of-project, negative is incarcerated)

> Is he the service owner?

> No, he's the guy who promised the customer that this service would never fall over. He also golfs with the head of the IT services department.

> Shit. I ask him if I have his permission to restart the service.

> "What, you want to break it more? Why do we pay you people to break things? You have to fix it now, there are millions of dollars at stake!"

> Does he know who is the service owner?

> Guess.

> Does he know where there's any documentation?

> Seriously?

> Right. Um. Fuck it. "# service tomcat restart"

## 2.6 Equipment in Detail

## 2.7 Special Equipment

**Potion of Socialability**

*I drink when I have occasion, and sometimes when I have no occasion.*
Miguel de Cervantes, *Don Quixote de la Mancha* (1605–1615) Part II (1615), Book III, Ch. 33.

The capacity of alcoholic drinks to provide sociability is well known. A standard dose is either one medium glass of beer, a small glass of wine, or a shot of spirit. Each standard dose reduces all physical skill rolls by 2, and apparently increases the CHA of others interacting with the character by 1. Follow the rules for drinking under section 2.2.

**Ring of The Significant Other**

*Marriage, n. A community consisting of a master, a mistress, and two slaves, making in all, two.*
Ambrose Bierce, *The Devil's Dictionary*, 1967.

This pair of rings are exchanged between significant others in the public ritual of marriage. In the establishment of this relationship certain contractual obligations are entered into depending on the jurisdiction. Characters wearing a Ring of Significant Other will receive a +2 bonus against Seduction attempts made against them. A ring of Significant Other costs $2000 each with a neglible weight.

**Knuth's The Art of Computing Programming**

*On two occasions, I have been asked [by members of Parliament], "Pray, Mr. Babbage, if you put into the machine wrong figures, will the right answers come out?"...I am not able rightly to apprehend the kind of confusion of ideas that could provoke such a question.*
Charles Babbage, *Passages from the life of a philosopher*, 1864

These four famous volumes contain many aspects of programming algorithms and analysis of their levels of efficiency. Each volumee will take five strategic turns to read, and a successful INT test with a target number of 15. If the check is failed, the character may check again at 13, 11, and to a minimum of 9. On the completion of all four volumes, the character gains an additional level in Technician or Scientist, as desired. When the books are present, a character engaging in any strategic Craft (Computing) or Knowledge (Science - Computing) test the character receives a +2 bonus. Each volume weighs 1.5 kilograms and costs $1000 for the set. 

**Charles Atlas Manual of Bodily Strength**

"The Insult that Made a Man out of Mac"! A manual that will train, from one strategic turn a day, into a Strength bonus. Every 10 days that a character makes use of the manual they will gain +1 STR, up to a maximum of +4. If a character misses a strategic turn they lose two day's value and will lose musculture if they do not. The Manual of Bodily Strength weighs 2.0 kilograms and costs $2000.

# 5.0 Scenarios : Fear and Loathing in Wellington
## 5.1 Setting

MY LIFE WITH BOSS 
by Dan LEstrange
“The life of a executive is a hard one. The horrific things you do make it difficult to feel good about yourself. If only  someone loved you. 

A dysfunctional relationship with your Boss in the high powered life of Corporate Executives for Newsprint Limited. A  game of modern horror and self loathing set with a backdrop of life at the top of the Journalism field.  

My Life with the Boss is a corporate adaptation of Paul Czege's award winning game My Life with Master. 

Prepare to  serve a most ambitious sociopath and eventually be his undoing.

My Life with the Boss was run at KapCon  XIX in Wellington, New Zealand, in January 2010.

There are six playable characters in My Life with the Boss. Forest Deacon, Chief Financial Officer, John Goines, Marketing Manager, Julia Wright, Chief of Visual Media, Verity Williams, Chief Editor, Jason Schuster, Chief Journalist, Rebekah Caulfield, Director of Human Resources Each character has been pre­created to fit convention play. Characters are detailed at the end of this document.

Each character has a more than human trait  and a less than human trait listed on their character sheets. These traits are, in practice, used as colour for the characters, yet they can do things to the flow of the game. Take notes of each more than human / less than human, anything that falls under these traits should be considered an automatic success (or failure).

Each character has two connections from the following: Petra Daniels (local Shortland Street actress) , Henry Dunant (local leader of Red Cross Orphans Charity) , Paul Reynolds (Jr Accountant of Newsprint Limited) , Yousef Ramoud (Routers Co – competitor Journalist) , “Open Wound” (Government Insider) . These connections provide both victims and moral support to the characters and each is used to inspire emotive responses from the characters. As they are tied to successfully resisting the Boss, the characters should want to assist and not harm their own connections and be reluctant to harm connections of other characters. 

**In detail – Petra Daniels (Local Celebrity)**

Petra is a local actress from a daily New Zealand soap – Shortland Street. She is has a ethereal beauty and her character suffers tragedy after tragedy during the soap which means that she inspires pity. Petra is however, rather new to the media scene, she could also be called naïve in respect to handling the media.

Petra is the target of the first commands for Julia Wright, Chief of Visual Media. As Julia is instructed to get raunchy pictures of Petra for page three of the Newspaper. This is a big step for the actress (if she is willing) as this will dash her current media image of homely goodness.

Petra has connections with John Goines (Marketing), whom she used to date before getting a media profile, Verity Williams (HR) whom she has had business dealings with and Jason Schuster (Chief Journalist) who has been stalking her for many years (although Petra is unaware of the infatuation).

Petra should inspire pity from the characters, as a personality who being abused by the media (and by extension the Boss) which will eventually result in her meltdown.  For inspiration to play her, look to Susan Boyle (UK Idol runner up), Lindsay Lohan (from before she became a media sensation to her current state) and Brittney Spears (with her public meltdown).

**In detail – Henry Dunant (Red Cross worker)**
Henry Dunant runs the local (struggling) Red Cross orphanage, just out of town. The orphanage is currently on a “campout” – as much from necessity as from choice – and Henry and his volunteers are doing the best that they can to ensure the orphans are well taken care of. Henry is aware of the media scene, although places little value on its worth. 

He is a campaigner for a better world through hard work, honest donations and good intentions.
Henry is the target of John Goines first command, and John Goines has been instructed to “woo” Henry to support a marketing campaign and generate a good public perception of Newsprint Limited. Henry has connections with Rebekah Caulfield (who has been siphoning funds to the Red Cross for years), Verity Williams (who he dates and has a relationship with), and Forest Deacon (old mate and drinking buddy).
Henry should inspire admiration, or a difficult struggle. Henry is doing the good work under a good cause, a complete opposite of the characters own plight. Henry is inspired by real world characters like Fred Hollows (Australian Eye specialist who used to work in the Philippines), Mother Teresa and Princess Diana.

**In detail – Paul Reynolds (Jr Accountant)**
Paul works for Newsprint Limited as a Junior Accountant, a job he got through his uncle (and connection) Forest Deacon. Paul is one of the linesmen of Newsprint Limited and is excited about his opportunity to work with Newsprint as all young employees are. Paul is unaware of the media scene, although is excited to learn. He is eager to do what his superiors ask of him and is generally unaware of the consequences of his actions.

Paul has connections with Forest Deacon (his Uncle) and Jason Schuster (a good mate).

Paul is the target of the first command of Verity Williams (Chief Editor), and Verity is instructed to send Paul into a potentially deadly situation because the Boss is disparaging of Paul’s letter to management. Paul is indirectly affected by Rebekah Caulfield’s first command as well, as Paul falls under the group that the Boss instructs Rebekah to cull from the company ranks.

Paul should inspire hope from the Characters, he represents what the characters may have felt when they began at Newsprint and what they may be feeling at the start of the game (a wish to do well for the Boss). Only the character increasing self loathing and realisation that the Boss is a tyrant differentiates Paul from the characters. Paul is inspired by any who has recently joined the job market, a person willing to go the extra step in order to cement their career in a 
new industry.

**In detail – Yousef Ramoud (Competitor Journalist)**
Yousef works for a rival company to Newsprint Limited; however he should represent the idea of a friendly rivalry rather than a hostile one. Yousef should give no reason for the characters to dislike him, other than the instructions of the Boss – he is meant to represent a healthy competition in the workplace. Yousef is also an Arab, and thus highlights the unfair racial bigotry that can arise in the media’s interpretation of public perception of Arabs and those from the middle east.

Yousef is well aware of the media’s capabilities and will fight back – targeting the organisation of Newsprint rather than the individual – if attacked by the characters. Yousef has connections with John Goines (old school mate) and Julia Wright (professional colleagues). Yousef is the target of the first command of Forest Deacon, Forest is instructed to “find dirt” on Yousef and discredit him as a journalist.

Yousef should inspire respect from the players, while the media industry can be considered to be a cutthroat business (especially in the Boss’s eyes), Yousef should seem to rise above it and still fight fairly. Yousef is inspired by the overwhelming majority of investigative journalists in the media industry to date. A real passion for getting the truth of the story and no love of the sensationalist practices of some papers in order to sell more.

**In detail – “Open Wound” (Government Insider)**
“Open Wound” is the codename for a Government insider. He represents the myriad of contacts that the journalistic community has to allow them to get the inside scoop on operations by the government. “Open Wound” also represents the shadier side of investigative journalism, where a no­questions­asked policy is still in place. “Open Wound” is the least at risk by the activities of the characters, his identity is a secret, his background shrouded in mystery. He will willingly go along with the characters if they chose to misdirect the activities of “Open Wound” to another connection.

“Open Wound” has connections with Julia Wright (Chief of Visual media) and Verity Williams (Chief Editor) as an informant and verifier of information. “Open Wound” is the target of the first command of Jason Schuster (Chief Journalist), and Jason is instructed to expose him to the Boss and find out everything that Jason is able to.“Open Wound” is inspired by Deep Throat (the insider from X­files and the Watergate scandal).

**The Boss**
Central to the success of My Life with the Boss, is the Boss. The aspects of the Boss are below (as per My Life with Master rules)

Aspect: Boss/CEO
Type:  Teacher
Needs:
Wants: Domination
More Money, More Readers, to be proven right in all things
Some aspects of the Boss
The following are some of the characteristics that the Boss will (or may) display during the game.
Ruthlessness., Uncaring., Profiteer., Driven., Racist., Rich., Uncharitable., Environmental Terrorist.,  Sensationalist., 
Bureaucratic., Overbearing., Pedantic., Favouritism., Ambiguous expectations/Goals., Loud/Rude/Talks over staff., 
Takes credit from staff.,  Discuss negative events continually and searches for faults in staff.,  Lacks integrity, breaks 
promises, and is dishonest., Unethical., Belittling., Micromanaging

**Playing the Boss**

Firstly, it must be said that the Boss is should not be treated like a normal character. The Boss should played more like considered a nature or a driving motivator to get the characters into a position where they feel that there is nothing more that they can do but resist the 

Boss’s commands.
When playing the Boss, it is useful to have a trigger – in my case it was a cigar – that highlights that the GM is playing the Boss to the players and allows the GM to get into character to say and do the things that the Boss wants to do.

The Boss is bigoted, racist, nasty and ruthless – however the Boss can not complete his objectives without the characters involvement (the Boss is also lazy). He has a confidence that his minions will attempt to complete the tasks as instructed, however lacks confidence in their ability to actually complete those tasks.

The Boss is misunderstood, the Boss wants to be liked, the Boss wants to be appreciated, and the Boss wants to be respected. However when the characters show that they “like” the Boss, or appreciate the Boss or even respect the Boss, the Boss can see through their guile and realises that it is just a grab for power of the Boss’s assets. 

The Boss has an extremely powerful position in the game, at least initially the characters will be unable to resist the Boss’s commands, the Boss should however begin with commands that allow the players to get into character, and continually escalate those commands until the characters realise that the Boss’s power is hollow and the characters have no choice but to resist. The Boss must be memorable if this game is to succeed. Be prepared to be flamboyant, loud, outspoken and to make a performance of the times that the Boss is centre stage.

The Boss is not the GM, nor is the GM the Boss. 

The Boss is just a motivator for the players, a source of information on what impossible task they should attempt to complete. The Boss should be an obstacle for the characters to overcome, not a cherished NPC who can escape any conflict.

**Introduction of the Game**
Always introduce yourself and the game, explain the rules and take your time about this. Be familiar with the rules as written of My Life with Master.

My conventions that are not listed in the rules as written for My Life with Master.
• Desperation, Intimacy and Sincerity dice are the domain of both the players and the GM. This will need to be  introduced at the start of play with the importance of the dice to success strenuously stressed.
• No more than 1 overture action in a row for any character.
• End Game and Horror Revealed scenes happen at set times. These will be extra scenes. Horror Revealed 
scenes are slightly re jigged to fit the game within the convention time frames.
• Bring each scene to its conflict as quickly as possible, the answer “yes, and...” should be the only one the GM requires until a conflict is declared (by either the player or GM). On average you will only have about 5 minutes to complete a scene.

**Horror Revealed**
In a slight change about the Horror Revealed, unfortunately in a convention setting you do not have the time to “waste” a scene with a character describing the horror revealed as opposed to generating Love or Self Loathing.
 
Horror Revealed only appearing at one of three times (at the 1 st  hour mark, the 2 nd  hour mark and in practice just before the end game mark), the player with the “Horror Revealed” is then instructed to describe the response of the public to the activities of the characters thus far.

I would begin by answering an open question relevant to the current events in the game – for example – “given that Henry Dunant has been vilified in the media, how does the public react to further fundraising by the Red Cross?”, and allowing the player to describe the response.
Opening Statement / Setting the scene
The scene: Characters are all sitting at the board room table, the Boss is hidden behind a large chair. He’s on the phone.
"Look here, you snivelling little turd, when I say I want those pictures ­ I want those pictures, I don't care if your 
halfwit mother wants to have a white xmas, you ain't getting any leave until those pictures hit MY desk. In fact, fuck it, 
you ain't getting any leave period ­ sit your arse down in the park outside that dumb bitch Petra Daniels house and wait 
for the picture you god damned lazy shit."
He turns to the characters
"Right, for Christ sake ­ hire a bloody Jew to do a job and you need to give them god damned road map just so they can 
find their own chopped up prick. This fucking company would go down the tubes if it wasn't for strong leadership and 
direction ­ MINE ­ I don't know why I hired you lot either ­ right lot of useless pricks you are."
"Who’s up first?"

Whomever chooses to take the first command will be your starting character, travel left from that player until you 
return to that player a second time (i.e. all characters have had two scenes, usually a command and an overture or 
attempting to complete a command). 
At that second return, you should be able to do an End Game or Horror Revealed check.

**First Run of Commands and player actions**

The following is the initial commands given to each character, note that with the exception of the first command (the 
player who responded to the opening statement) each character can choose to take a command, do an overture or act out 
a command.
Players should be able to set the scene for what ever action they choose to take, the GM should provide suggestions 
based on the background material, but the players should have most of the narrative control.
The players are likely to take the narrative outside the boardroom, or to other unusual places, the GM’s best answer to 
any suggestion or request by the players is “yes, and...” The game is currently set in Wellington, New Zealand (feel 
free to change as relevant). 
Each player should have the opportunity twice to perform an action (within the first round it is extremely likely that 
everyone gets at least one command). To keep to the time line, this should only take about 50 minutes to complete.


Forest Deacon
"The sodding bean counter huh? Keeping your retirement fund clean are you? ­ Yes I know about your tucked away 
savings ­ be thankful that I haven't turned you in to the IRD. Right, I have a job for you, simple enough for even you to 
do. Our reader numbers are down, and the competition is getting nasty. Time to buy them out. Routers Co is within the 
price range, but I want to buy it for a steal ­ their head journalist ­ Ramoud ­ he supplies all the integrity for the 
company ­ defame him. Destroy him. Make him nothing in the readers’ eyes. I want scandal; I want to know that he’s a 
gay loving, neo­fascist, terrorism supporting Arab. Make it happen!"
John Goines
"Oh Christ its you. You sold your own mother yet? My lord man I ain't seen such a dirty leech since my time in 
Malaysia ­ god damned Malaysians ­ suck your blood they do. Steal the shirt from your back they will. So... what can I 
have you do for me huh? Something you won't fuck up hopefully, but I'm not holding my breath. I need a new 
corporate face of Newsprint limited, something bullshit and squishy, light­hearted yet.... heart­warming to the stupid 
masses. Something.... charities... charities are good. There is a Red Cross orphans camp up near Trentham way, sign a 
deal ­ get them to advocate buying Newsprint publications. Get their boss up here for a photo shot ­ shaking hands and 
that sort of bullshit rubbish ­ but make sure they are presentable... I want sympathetic, not pathetic."
Julia Wright
"How are you doing honey? Liking the good life down in that library of yours? You know you could make VP one day; 
you'd just need to pop those tits out once and a while and do a dance for the rest of the team. The boys here would be 
salivating over you in no time. Your job is a simple one baby, time for Newsprint to get glossy ­ and I mean sexy. I 
need hot pics... and I mean HOT. Get me my nude shot of Petra Daniels ­ you know the one ­ the slut from Shorty 
Street. That'll bring the readers in, everyone likes a bit of arse on page 2! and would it hurt to wear a low cut top from 
time to time! Its like looking at a slate wall every time you walk in here..."

Verity Williams
"Verity ­ my overpaid, under qualified, waste of time editor. What do you do when not trying to screw up my paper? 

pull the wings off flies? Steal candy from children? Christ if I was a father I would get the child to run 10 miles to get 
away from your ugly mug ­ the wicked witch of the west you are! Well its time to earn your keep, accounting have a 
new boy ­ Paul something... Reynolds I think. He sent me a bloody letter "Dear Sir, I very much enjoy being part of 
your fine company and would like to express my gratitude about granting me this opportunity to help build Newsprint 
to the best that it can be" ­ fucking brown noser if any I thought so. Time to teach him a lesson ­ there is a Gang HQ out 
in Newtown, tell him that the boss needs something special from the Gang leader ­ something that would make the 
Boss even more grateful that we hired this snivelling shit... convince Paul to go get me a Daddie fresh from the pen!... 
ha ha!... should come back bow legged he will!"
(FYI – “Daddie fresh from the Pen” is a recently release Sexual Offender)

Jason Schuster
"I thought we fired you? God Damn I need to talk to HR. Right, as we have you we should bloody well use you. There 
is a secret government agent ­ "Open Wound" is what they call him. He needs to be exposed ­ my friends in the 
Beehive are getting might pissed off at the info he is spreading around ­ and I need my friends to be happy. I need to 
know his name, his department, his fucking favourite position and I need it recorded. Bring me that recording!"
Rebekah Caulfield
"Still stalking all the office hotties are we Beks? I know your secret. Looking up files is just another form of a peep 
show to you isn't it? Okay, I have jobs for you. I am getting sick and tired of all the bloody slackers that we have 
hired... fucking ugly women with kids, Jews and Malay. Slackers all of them. Fire them. All. I want all their contracts 
terminated by the end of the week ­ and hire me some new people ­ attractive women, Aryan men ­ business men, real 
workers ­ none with kids. Call it a restructure or something, and make it look nice in the press."


Check for End Game / Horror Revealed
After each player has had a turn twice, go around the table and do a check for End Game or Horror Revealed. This is 
also a good time to summarise what is happening in the game world (the Horror Revealed is a good way to allow the 
players to do the summarising).
N.B. Horror Revealed:
In a slight change about the Horror Revealed, unfortunately in a convention setting you do not have the time to “waste” 
a scene with a character describing the horror revealed as opposed to generating Love or Self Loathing. 
Horror Revealed only appearing at one of three times (at the 1 st  hour mark, the 2 nd  hour mark and in practice just before 
the end game mark), the player with the “Horror Revealed” is then instructed to describe the response of the public to 
the activities of the characters thus far.
I would begin by answering an open question relevant to the current events in the game – for example – “given that 
Henry Dunant has been vilified in the media, how does the public react to further fundraising by the Red Cross?”, and 
allowing the player to describe the response.
Second Round commands and player actions
The second commands the characters received are partially dependent on the results of their first command (if they 
have or haven’t completed it), and partially dependent on the actions of the other characters. Guides to the characters 


for orders follow.
As a loose guide follow the below instructions, however always escalate.
Forest Deacon
If successful ­ Ramoud should be disgraced. Townsfolk should become more cynical about life, morose and depressed. 
Anti­monopoly or anti­globalisation protests are starting to rise and often they stop at the Newsprint Limited head 
office. While Newsprint haven't yet brought Routers (although CFO could do it), it is obvious to the population that this 
is what it intends. Newsprint limited reader numbers remain unchanged. CFO next task could be to FIRE all the 
workers from Routers and set it up as a shell company for Newsprint to launder money ­ Paul would be “volunteered” 
to oversee this operation.
If unsuccessful ­ Routers (and Ramoud) runs a campaign against monopolies and greedy corporations with their 
wealthy benefactors. The boss is not impressed. Orders CFO to start laundering money (with a fall guy ­ Paul) hiding it 
as donations to the Red Cross. 
The key to Forest’s escalation is either through his connections (putting Paul or Henry Dunant into trouble or dire 
straights), or using his money (his “more than human”) for increasingly nefarious deeds. Order Forest to buy things – 
like the Red Cross and then destroy them, order Forest to cut funding to things – like staff members superannuation or 
leave payouts – order him to use that money for the Boss’s benefit.

Eventually Forest will crack, and that really is the idea.

John Goines

If successful ­ Henry Dunant should be ready for photo shoot/publicity stunt with the Boss ­ Townsfolk should laud 
Henry Dunant as reaching one of the big corporations ­ Henry is nominated for Wellingtonian of the Year (for his 
charity work and stuff). Newsprint reader numbers remain the same. The boss is not impressed, in fact, he’s angry. 
DCC next task should be to put Petra Daniels (naked) and Henry Dunant in the same room. Time to disgrace him.

If unsuccessful, the boss is not impressed and above remains.
John Goines is often played as a suave media marketeer, so attack him were it hurts. He generally needs orders that are 
leading others into trouble, not trouble for himself directly – for example, bringing Petra Daniels to the Boss’s room 
and ordered to remain outside, or creating situations where Yousef could be confused as a terrorist (i.e. “mistakenly” 
putting a story out with a picture of Yousef about potential terrorism in Wellington).


Julia Wright
If successful ­ Petra Daniels should be "exposed" in the media ­ Townsfolk start to hunger for more sensationalist press 
­ reality TV shows start to rise, the porn industry in Wellington reports record growth. Newsprint reader numbers 
increase, the boss wants more. CVM next task would be to photograph government officials in compromising positions. 
Get the scandal.
If unsuccessful, the Boss is not impressed, his page 2 doesn't have a story ­ orders CVM to get insider story pronto. 
Either that or lose her job!!
Julia can be attacked through her connections, “Open Wound” or Yousef, although generally they do not hold a lot of 
weight with the players. Julia is often portrayed as a confident worker, successful in her own right, and further attacks 

on her legitimacy as a photojournalist has worked in escalation with Julia. Order Julia to take photos of prominent 
connections in the game and then have the Newspaper print outright lies about what the photo is attempting to portray 
(or lies about what the situation was in the first place). Order Julia to then begin doctoring photos to match scandalous 
stories.
Verity Williams
If successful Paul should be harmed ­ Violence and riots are more common by the townsfolk, violence seems "verified" 
as a valid course of action. Sexual assaults and rape on the rise. The boss doesn't care Newsprint readership declines 
(which doesn't make the boss happy). Orders CE to blame the Red Cross for the rise in violence (it harbours criminals), 
to get proof that this is happening, and to bring the Red Cross to justice. Also Paul is brought to the office and CE 
blamed for his plight.
If unsuccessful, Paul unharmed, bosses "fun" was inhibited, he’s not happy. Orders CE to verify a government 
conspiracy (that the Govt is bankrupt, John Key is a puppet to the US, and the RBA is about to go under) with her 
"contact" and rival company Routers Co.

Verity’s first instruction is the one that brings violence into the game, and thus escalation of Verity’s orders in practice 
tends to be quite natural. Order her to allow stories of Paul Reynolds (lies all) to go to print, have the Boss order her to 
obey the “Boys Club” and step aside for another editor (who doesn’t do any editing) and then order her to take the fall 
when he fails. Verity in practice also tends to get out there and attempt to stop others from completing their orders (in 
particular re Henry Dunant).
Jason Schuster
If successful ­ "Open Wound" should be compromised but either way ­ Townsfolk want to know more about the 
Governments dealings, racial attacks on the rise as the Boss slants the story to the fact that he is a Jew (or Malay, or an 
ugly woman). Newsprint Readership rises, the Boss wants more. Needs more proof that the Jews are responsible for all 
things wrong in this world. Orders DOO out to get proof that Henry Dunant (another Jew) is a corrupt cheat, and if they 
can't find the info ­ to make it up! 

Jason is a true journalist, so continue to order him to “get the story”. And if he can’t get the story to “make the story”. 
This can be useful for the players to keep track of the activities of the game if Jason is ordered to track and report. 
Eventually the Boss will order Jason to get the story on the assassination of one of the connections, or rather hands 
Jason a Gun.
 
Rebekah Caulfield
If successful, all Jews/ugly women/Malays should be fired ­ including Paul Reynolds, and new employees hired.
Townsfolk accept the "restructure" or whatever it was called without comment, racial attacks on the rise. No change in 
Newsprint readership. Paul Reynolds starts a lawsuit for illegal dismissal and Boss orders DHR to justify the dismissals 
or bribe the courts to throw the case out ­ Open Wound could be useful there. (either mentioned by boss or others)
If unsuccessful, Boss not happy. Orders DHR to cut costs in other ways, cut everyone’s pay by 50% (except the boss) 
and her own by 75%. Initiate a performance reviews on all senior staff and report back.
Rebekah’s escalation tends to go towards ordering her to strip other characters of their benefits (listed on the character 
sheets), or Ordering Rebekah to oversee further cutbacks in Newsprint. Attacking Rebekahs connections Petra Daniels 
or Henry Dunant tends also to stir Rebekah into action.

As MacKenzie's layout was seen by more and more people, a collective shudder ran through the office (but) MacKenzie's dominance was so total there was nobody left in the organisation who could rein him in except Murdoch. (Everyone in the office) seemed paralysed ­ "looking like rabbits in the headlights" ­ as one hack described them. The error staring them in the face was too glaring. It obviously wasn't a silly mistake; nor was it a simple oversight. Nobody really had any comment on it—they just took one look and went away shaking their heads in wonder at the enormity of it. It was a 'classic smear'.
Quote by Peter Chippendale and Chris Horrie on The Sun's reporting of  the 1989 Hillsborough Disaster

Hints, Tips and Advice
The following are some final hints, tips and advice before we get to the End Game.
1. Keep the game moving, don’t stop
2. Escalate, Escalate, Escalate
3.
4.
5.
6.

Watch your time, if necessary award “Self­Loathing” or “Love” to characters outside their turn if the actions 
seem warranted and your time is low
“Yes and...” is your greatest tool as a GM.
You have 5 minutes to bring each scene to a conflict point, know the My Life With Master system intuitively 
to bring out what the players need to roll as soon as they ask.
Continue to encourage the players to award sincerity, intimacy or desperation dice. Lead by example.
It is quite possible that you have a troublesome player or two; usually these are quickly identified as a player who is 
enjoying the depraved requests of the Boss and is asking for more, thus not resisting the Boss (and thus not being able 
to complete the game).
There are a couple of strategies for this sort of player, the first is to escalate the commands given by the Boss until the 
player is in a situation where they can do nothing but resist. This is fraught with difficulty as it may result in the GM 
breaking the rules set down in the disclaimer.

The second strategy is to give the character commands that are impossible to complete. One of my examples was 
ordering the character to go around to all of the shops in the Wellington region and replace the front page with a new 
one; this was an action that the character had no chance of completing. Further escalation of these sorts of commands 
eventually leads the player to the believe that the Boss is really just a nasty person and should be resisted.
End Game

The End Game possibilities are as wild as the players you will have, however a couple of points the GM should be 
aware of at the End Game stage.
The character will always “win” the End Game, and the Boss knows this, he will attempt to go all out to defend or fight 
or attempt to convince the character that going against the Boss is not the best way. The Boss will beg, he will make 
lewd remarks, he will insult, he will cry, he will scream. As the GM it is your responsibility to make this happen, stand 
up and take it too the players – this is the Boss’s last hurrah.
Conclusions
Know the background of the game, know the rules of My Life with Master, and portray the Boss as wild as you can. 
These three elements will ensure that you have a unique and fun experience when playing My Life with the Boss.
In the two times I ran My Life with the Boss at KapCon, both ended very differently and took very different tracks. 
This is to be expected, some characters will fixate on protecting their connections and growing Love, others will 
attempt to satisfy the Boss (growing their Self Loathing) and others again will attempt to disrupt the actions of the other 
characters. 
Ultimately however, and this is what My Life with Master is about, it will return to resisting the Boss and completing 
the End Game.
As I have suggested, play the Boss to the hilt, this is one of the ways that the players will remember this game and get 
enjoyment from it, the second point in which the players will have enjoyment is the relative freedom they have from a 
GM that says “yes, and ...” to all of their requests.
